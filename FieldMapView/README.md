# FieldMapView
A demo of Map View as in Field Trip app with smooth animations.

FieldMapView is a demo app with a maps fragment alongwith a horizontal recycler view.
This app was made in the first 6 hours of the [PolicyHack](http://policyhack.in/) hackathon.
(This is the UI base of the original app. The full app with extensive data on Education in India can be found [here](https://github.com/The-XYZ/education_android)).

The UI is inspired from the Field Trip app. The demo also has data inflated in recycler view using Parse as a backend but you
can insert the data in any way you like.
